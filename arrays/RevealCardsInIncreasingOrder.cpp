// 950. Reveal Cards In Increasing Order

// In a deck of cards, every card has a unique integer.  You can order the deck in any order you want.

// Initially, all the cards start face down (unrevealed) in one deck.

// Now, you do the following steps repeatedly, until all cards are revealed:

//     Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and take it out of the deck.
//     If there are still cards in the deck, put the next top card of the deck at the bottom of the deck.
//     If there are still unrevealed cards, go back to step 1.  Otherwise, stop.

// Return an ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards in increasing order.

// The first entry in the answer is considered to be the top of the deck.


// Solution: sort the array.
// do reverse operation above.
// vector.back() -> last element of vector
// vector.insert(it, val);
